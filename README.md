  I'm Sriya Vemuri. I am interested in anything and everything related to machine learning and data. I love learning about random things in the universe and getting passionate over the tiniest details. I am pursuing a combined master's degree in business and data science from Rutgers University.

In my free time, I enjoy watching sports, playing video games, reading, listening to music, keeping up with whatever Apple is working on, and learning about modes of transportation. Some things I learned about recently:
  <ul>
    <li>The Airbus A380-800</li>
    <li>Electric car battery types</li>
    <li>The U.S. Interstate Highway System naming convention</li>
  </ul>
